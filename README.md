# News App Prototype

A simple news application that aggregates and displays news articles from various sources.

## Features

- Browse latest news articles
- Onboarding screen for new users
- News list with category filtering (business focus)
- Detailed news article view
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Custom news card components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android/iOS device or emulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-app-prototype.git
cd news-app-prototype
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Configure your API key:
   Update the API key in `lib/config/network/api_endpoint.dart`:
```dart
static const String apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

For specific platforms:
```bash
flutter run -d android    # Run on Android
flutter run -d ios        # Run on iOS
```

## API Integration

This app uses [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) for fetching news articles. The app is configured to fetch:
- Top headlines by country (US) and category (business)
- Various news categories

You'll need to:
1. Sign up for a free account at NewsAPI.org
2. Get your API key
3. Replace the API key in `lib/config/network/api_endpoint.dart`

**Note**: The current API key in the code should be replaced with your own for production use.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter
- Dart
- HTTP package for API calls
- NewsAPI.org for news data
- Feature-based architecture (auth, news)
- MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller)
